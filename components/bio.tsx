        I&apos;m Brian, a software developer and educator living in Boston,
        Massachusetts. I run Spanning Tree, a video series teaching topics in
        computer science and mathematics. At Harvard University, I&apos;ve
        created and taught courses about artificial intelligence and web
        programming. I&apos;ve also been a course head for CS50, Harvard&apos;s
        introductory course in computer science, and a co-instructor for CS51,
        Harvard&apos;s course on abstraction and design in computing. I
        currently work at Byteboard, developing a more accurate and equitable
        process for engineering hiring. I&apos;ve worked previously at
        Automattic, Palantir, and the National Speech and Debate Association. I
        graduated from Harvard College in 2019 with a degree in computer science
        and linguistics and from Harvard Graduate School of Education in 2021
        with a master&apos;s degree in technology, innovation, and education.
