      I'm [Your Name], a Backend developer and Competitive programmer.
      Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge by studying design principles and diving deeper into the world of competitive programming through the Competitive Programming Handbook.
      With a strong foundation in programming languages, I'm proficient in Django, Python, Go, and Rust.
      In the past, I've had the opportunity to achieve a notable feat - I secured the 10th position in the West Asia ICPC competition.
      I'm passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field and exploring new technologies to improve my skills.
