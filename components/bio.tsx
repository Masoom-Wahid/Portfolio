      <p>
        I'm Brian, a software developer and educator living in Boston,
        Massachusetts. I run Spanning Tree, a video series teaching topics in
        computer science and mathematics. At Harvard University, I've created
        and taught courses about artificial intelligence and web programming.
        I've also been a course head for CS50, Harvard's introductory course in
        computer science, and a co-instructor for CS51, Harvard's course on
        abstraction and design in computing. I currently work at Byteboard,
        developing a more accurate and equitable process for engineering hiring.
        I've worked previously at Automattic, Palantir, and the National Speech
        and Debate Association. I graduated from Harvard College in 2019 with a
        degree in computer science and linguistics and from Harvard Graduate
        School of Education in 2021 with a master's degree in technology,
        innovation, and education. Contact me at brian@brianyu.me.
